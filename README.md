### Calculator (2025)

This application is a visually interactive calculator built using Processing, a Java-based graphics framework. It features a custom Button class to manage the appearance and behavior of each clickable element, including digits, operations, and utility functions. The interface is designed with hover effects, rounded buttons, and a dynamic display that updates in real time as users input values or perform calculations. The calculator supports basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as advanced functions such as exponentiation, square root, and absolute value.

Internally, the calculator tracks two operands (l and r), a result, and the current operation. Input is managed through a string (dVal) that reflects the user's current entry, which is parsed into float values for computation. The mousePressed() function handles all user interactions, updating the state based on which button is clicked. The design also includes safeguards like input length limits and decimal point validation, making the calculator both functional and user-friendly.

### Making Cars (2025)

This application is a Processing sketch that simulates cars moving across the screen using object-oriented programming. In the setup, a 600 by 600 window is created and multiple `Car` objects are initialized. Two individual cars are made with fixed colors (red and green), while an array of 100 additional cars is filled with randomly generated colors. Each car is assigned a random starting position, speed, and direction when it is constructed. The use of a class allows the program to efficiently manage many cars at once by reusing the same structure and behaviors for every object.

During the draw loop, the background is refreshed and every car is displayed and moved across the screen. The `display()` method draws each car using rectangles to represent the body and wheels, with slight visual differences depending on whether the car is moving left or right. The `move()` method updates the car’s position based on its speed and direction, creating smooth horizontal motion. When a car reaches one side of the screen, it wraps around to the opposite side, allowing the animation to continue endlessly. Overall, this application demonstrates how arrays, classes, and methods work together to create a dynamic and visually engaging animation.
