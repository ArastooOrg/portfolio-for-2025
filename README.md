### Calculator (2025)

This application is a visually interactive calculator built using Processing, a Java-based graphics framework. It features a custom Button class to manage the appearance and behavior of each clickable element, including digits, operations, and utility functions. The interface is designed with hover effects, rounded buttons, and a dynamic display that updates in real time as users input values or perform calculations. The calculator supports basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as advanced functions such as exponentiation, square root, and absolute value.

Internally, the calculator tracks two operands (l and r), a result, and the current operation. Input is managed through a string (dVal) that reflects the user's current entry, which is parsed into float values for computation. The mousePressed() function handles all user interactions, updating the state based on which button is clicked. The design also includes safeguards like input length limits and decimal point validation, making the calculator both functional and user-friendly.
